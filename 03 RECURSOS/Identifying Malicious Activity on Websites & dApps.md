Identifying and Avoiding Malicious dApps

A common way for scammers to trick crypto investors is through fake apps available for download through Google Play and the Apple App Store. Always check the description for grammatical errors and typos, and read the reviews. It is always safer to download the app directly from the official platform/website.

Website Security

Scammers are capable of making their website addresses (URLs) look just like the authentic URLs of some popular cryptocurrency exchange sites, like Binance and Bittrex. If you use your login credentials on a scam site, this can lead to theft of your funds.
