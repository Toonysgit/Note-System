## [[Deploy your First ERC-721 Contract]]

Deploy your first NFT contract. Deploy your contract in the Polygon Testnet and attach the contract hash

To complete this activity you need an APP_ID and an API_KEY. Visit https://docs.vottun.io/start/get-your-api-key where you will find how to obtain them.

Go to the Smart Contracts section at https://app.vottun.io/. Under the 'All Smart Contracts' tab click on NFT 721. Once you are at the Detail View select the 'Deploy' button. 

Select the API_KEY and the NETWORK you want to deploy to. Make sure you have enough balance for the native tokens of the network you want to deploy the contract to. In case you have the balance at 0, you can go to the wallet section and watch the video on how to get tokens for Testnet.

Please provide in which network did you deploy the contract, tx hash, the contract address and the contract specs id so we can check your answer.

You can check the contract specs id in the smart contract detail page
