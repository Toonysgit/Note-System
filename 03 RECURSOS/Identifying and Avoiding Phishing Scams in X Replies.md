[[Certik]]

Web3 projects often make announcements through an initial tweet, followed by additional information in subsequent replies. Scammers exploit this by posing as official accounts, replying with phishing messages to entice users into participating in fraudulent airdrops or events.

On June 9th, 2024, a user on platform X reported losing over $400,000 worth of $MANEKI tokens. This happened after they unknowingly approved a token transfer on a fraudulent airdrop website linked in a reply under the project's official tweet.

Phishing replies under the original tweet

A scammer's X account, with an identical display name and a username very similar to the official one, posted a reply mimicking the project's communication. This reply lured users to visit a fraudulent website to claim rewards.

Taking a closer look at the phishing reply

The scammer's account used the same profile picture, display name, and a very similar username to the legitimate project's handle, @UnrevealedXYZ. The reply also included "2/" at the beginning, making it appear as part of an official thread.

Prevalence of similar scams

These scams are common in replies to tweets from trending projects. Some projects use an "End of Thread" message to indicate the end of their official communication, but this practice is not yet widespread.

X offers 80% price cut for gold check accounts amid surge in crypto scams

Usernames on X, often grayed out next to the display name, can go unnoticed. The gold check icon, signifying verification on X, can give a false sense of security. Scammers exploit this by either passing the verification or taking over accounts with legitimate gold checks.

Never click links from unverified sources

Phishing links are widespread, especially in public posts and unsolicited messages on social platforms. Always exercise caution and avoid visiting websites not directly published by official sources to protect your funds from being drained by scammers.
