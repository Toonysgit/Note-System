Intro to Crypto Compliance

Crypto compliance involves following legal and regulatory standards governing cryptocurrency use. The goal is to prevent money laundering, fraud, and tax evasion. Effective compliance includes implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, reporting suspicious transactions to regulatory bodies, and ensuring transparency in all crypto transactions.

Key Components of Effective Compliance

**Know Your Customer (KYC):** Verification of user identities to prevent illegal activities.

**Anti-Money Laundering (AML):** Measures to detect and report suspicious transactions.

**Transaction Transparency:** Ensuring all crypto transactions are transparent and traceable.

**Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):** Enforces securities laws to protect investors.

**Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC):** Administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions.
