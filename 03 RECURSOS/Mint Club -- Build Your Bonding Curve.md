Mint Club | Bonding Curve Backed Token/NFT Creator
](https://mint.club/)

Mint Club is a platform designed to easily create bonding curve-backed tokens or NFTs. It allows users to tokenize assets using any ERC20 token as the base asset in the bonding curve pool. The platform offers a no-code solution, highly customizable bonding curve designs, adjustable creator royalties, and an intuitive interface for trading bonding curve assets.

Understanding Mint Club’s Bonding Curve Asset Creation

Mint Club enables the creation of bonding curve assets, either as tokens (ERC20) or NFTs (ERC1155). Users can:

- Select from various curve types like linear, exponential, or flat line.
    
- Adjust price variation intervals.
    
- Set initial minting price, free minting allocation, final minting price, and supply.
    
- Deploy assets on multiple Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks.

Minting and Burning Bonding Curve Assets

Minting (buying) and burning (selling) bonding curve assets on Mint Club follows these principles:

- When buying, the price curve determines the base token amount to be paid, enabling a swap and minting new tokens.
    
- When selling, the curve calculates the base tokens to be returned, burning the corresponding bonding curve tokens in the process.

---
Implementing Lockups

The platform includes a lock-up tool that allows creators to set up contract-bound lock-up schedules for their tokens. Users can specify unlock times and recipient addresses, ensuring tokens remain secure until the lock-up period ends.
