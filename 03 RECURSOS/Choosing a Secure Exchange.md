This exploration covers how to choose a secure exchange and common phishing risks.

Introduction to Exchange Security

Crypto exchanges are platforms where users can buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies. Choosing a secure and reputable exchange is crucial for protecting your assets.

Choosing a Secure Exchange

Look for exchanges that implement robust security measures such as 2FA, cold storage of funds, and encryption protocols.

Look for exchanges that run bounty programs, conduct regular penetration tests and security audits, and they have a public Proof-of-Reserves available for review. In addition, please be cautious if the exchange has experienced any security incidents in the past.
