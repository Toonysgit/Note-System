The essentials of Code Security in Web3 and the role of security audits, audit reports, code repositories and smart contract verification.

Understanding Code Security in Web3

In decentralized applications, code security is critical. It sets the rules for smart contracts and blockchains, where even minor errors can lead to significant, irreversible financial losses.

---
Role of Security Audit

Security audits are a fundamental measure to enhance code security, involving both manual and automated review processes to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities. These audits help prevent security breaches that could be costly.

---
Interpreting Audit Reports

While essential, audits are not security guarantees. Interpreting an audit involves verifying the version of the code audited, the coverage of the audit across the codebase, the auditor's reputation, and how many findings were resolved. These details are crucial for evaluating the thoroughness and impact of an audit.

Code Security Variations by Platform

The level of risk can vary significantly across different blockchain platforms. For example, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) contracts might use well-tested ERC libraries that provide a higher degree of transparency and reliability for specific use cases.

Monitoring Code Repositories

A project's GitHub repository can offer insights into its code maturity and development activity. Regular updates and active community involvement are good indicators of a project’s commitment to maintaining secure and robust code.

Ensuring Accuracy of Deployed Contracts

Sometimes the version of a smart contract deployed on-chain differs from what was audited. It’s crucial to verify this, and Skynet aids this process with Contract Verification badges, which confirm whether the deployed version matches the audited code.
