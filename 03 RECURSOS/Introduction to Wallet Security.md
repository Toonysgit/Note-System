Custodial Wallets vs. Non-Custodial Wallets

**Custodial Wallet**: Custodial wallets, primarily utilized by centralized exchanges (CEXs), maintain control of the wallet on behalf of the user. They offer convenience for individuals who prefer not to manage multiple keys and seed phrases.

**Non-Custodial Wallet**: Non-custodial wallets allow you to own and manage your private keys and crypto. While the level of security depends on how securely users manage their keys, non-custodial wallets empower individuals to maintain full control and mitigate third party risks.

Hot Wallets vs. Cold Wallets

**Hot Wallets**: Connected to the internet, typically software-based. While convenient, they are more vulnerable to online attacks.

**Cold Wallets**: Cold wallets, or hardware wallets, store your private keys offline on a physical device. These offer more security but can be less convenient for frequent transactions.

A good security strategy involves using a mix of both, depending on your needs.
