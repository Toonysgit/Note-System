Operational Risks in Web3 Security

Operational risks are about the security threats that come from how a project is managed, not just from the code. It’s vital for projects to demonstrate a strong commitment to ongoing security practices to protect against these risks.

Learning from Past Security Incidents

Reviewing past security incidents helps projects and users understand what went wrong and how it was handled. This analysis is crucial for assessing a project’s resilience and its readiness for future challenges.

---
Disaster Recovery Planning

Projects having a plan for when things go wrong is crucial. Disaster recovery involves outlining a response strategy helping to minimize damage and restore operations as quickly as possible.

In the event of a security incident, you can always reach out to us by completing the Incident Response form.

The Role of Bug Bounty Programs

Bug bounty programs use the power of the ethical hacker community to find vulnerabilities before they can be exploited maliciously. By offering large rewards, projects can attract skilled hackers to test and secure their systems.

---
Operating a Successful Bug Bounty

A successful bug bounty program requires clear guidelines, fair rewards, and a reliable platform for submissions (like CertiK or Immunefi). Effective management of these programs ensures valuable feedback from the community.

Security of Website and Non-Chain Components

Many parts of a Web3 project aren't on the blockchain, such as websites and software applications. These components must also be secured, as they can be targeted by hackers and pose significant security risks.
