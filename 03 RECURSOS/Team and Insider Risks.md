The Importance of Teams in Web3 Projects

One of the biggest risks in Web3 is team risk. A verified and competent team shows the project is built on solid foundations and maintains high security standards. Lack of expertise or integrity can lead to poor management and vulnerabilities.

Risks of Unverified and Anonymous Teams

Projects with unverified or anonymous teams present a higher risk for investors and users. Without transparency about who is behind a project, it’s difficult to assess the team's skills, intentions, and accountability, increasing the risk of fraud and mismanagement.

---
Evaluating for Insider Risk

The biggest risk often comes from inside the team, someone who misuses their access to the codebase or private keys, either for personal gain or to harm the projects. These risks are heightened by anonymous team hirings.

The Role of KYC & Team Verification

KYC verifications are an important measure for providing internal and external assurance. These independent processes help ensure that team members are who they say they are and can be held accountable.
